The National Council of SPCA&#8217;s (NSPCA) is appealing to members of the public to take extra precautions for their animals during the severe weather conditions forecast for this week, starting this evening in the Western Cape. The NSPCA urges animal owners to keep their pets indoors and ensure that their other animals living outdoors have access to adequate shelter for protection against the cold and wet weather conditions. Animals should also be provided with sufficient bedding in such weather conditions.
