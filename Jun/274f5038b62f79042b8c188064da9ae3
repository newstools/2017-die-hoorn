About 3000 4000 residents are displaced, which means that they currently stay with friends or relatives. Several evacuated areas were declared safe, and people have been moving back to their houses. Approximately 800 people, are still being accommodated in halls. It has been estimated that 300 structures have burned down, or were damaged in the fire.
