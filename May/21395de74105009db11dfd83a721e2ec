A TV CREW from The Bay TV that visited Oudts hoorn over the weekend was astonished by the variety of tourist attractions in the Greater Oudtshoorn. I always thought that Oudtshoorn is just another small town somewhere in the Western Cape, but was amazed by the number of tourist attractions in Oudtshoorn, its warm reception and the quality of accommodation, said the producer of the show, Zininzi Mgoqi.The TV crew visited the Cango Caves, Wilgewandel, Cango Ostrich Farm, Cango Wildlife Ranch, Safari Ostrich Farm and experienced a township tour.The Bay TV visit to Oudtshoorn followed the Tourism Indaba, one of the largest tourism marketing events on the African calendar which was held in Durban. Representatives from Oudtshoorn and De Rust Tourism, the Cango Caves and other tourism institutions attended the Indaba.The crew was invited by a local DJ, Sibusiso DJ Siso Appolis (23) to his birthday party in Bongolethu. Appolis then requested the crew to feature Oudtshoorn in their programme. The Oudts hoorn Municipality in conjunction with the Oudtshoorn and De Rust Tourism organised the itinerary for the crew.The 30 minute broadcast on the Ekse Mamela show featuring Oudtshoorn can be watched on 2 June between 18:00 and 19:00 on channel 260.
