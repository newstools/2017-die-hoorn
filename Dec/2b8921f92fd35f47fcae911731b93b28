  Prince Albert is ready to blow you away with the grandeur of the great Karoo this December.
These days it’s so easy to get disconnected to your loved ones, which is ironic because we have never been as connected as we are (digitally). It’s time to switch off your mobile devices and explore the amazing unfiltered landscape that contains a lot of hidden gems for the whole family to enjoy. We are much more health conscious these days and the beautiful landscape of Prince Albert will make your outdoor hiking, biking or cycling a breeze. First of all you have to work with the rhythm of the day. By 6 am the sun has already made its appearance, so the early morning hours are perfect for outdoor activities. Go for a friendly run or go cycling by hiring bicycles from either Dennehof Tours or Prince Albert Cycles. Go for a brisk walk through the town, which is a
very well preserved architectural marvel. On Saturday mornings at 7 am, the locals have a friendly, informal 5 km timed walk or parkrun which you can join absolutely free. By now you would have worked up a healthy appetite. African Relish is a cooking school that has fun interactive cooking lessons that will not only satisfy, but exceed your expectations. This is a great opportunity for the whole family to bond, experience and learn about South African food and culture of the beautiful Karoo.
End off your your amazing day settling down under a star filled sky with the ones you love and enjoy a picture only the Karoo can paint.
With views like these, it’s easy to see why so many fall in love with the unfiltered Prince Albert. To find out more about Prince Albert, visit:
